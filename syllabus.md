### Description

__Math 13__ Introduction to the theory and practice of statistics. Visualizing data: graphs and histograms. Describing data: measures of location, spread, and correlation. Probability theory and random variables; binomial and normal distributions. Drawing conclusions from data: confidence intervals; hypothesis testing z-tests, t-tests. Regression.

Upon completion of this course, students will:

1. Find and evaluate statistical information in discussions and presentations
2. Use statistical procedures and standard techniques in data gathering, summary, and presentations.
3. Interpret data sampling and inferential statistics (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.)
4. Describe the rules of probability and the role of probability distributions such as the Binomial, Normal, and various other models.


### Computer Access

You must have regular access to the web outside of class for reading the online interactive text, taking online quizzes, and using links to statistical computation.



### Online Text: Open Learning Initiative (OLI)

- You will be using one of the Statistics courses from the Open Learning Initiative (OLI).
- This interactive text has a cost of $20, available at: [https://oli.cmu.edu/](https://oli.cmu.edu/)
- You can find the instructions for accessing the OLI text [here](oli).
- Your computer will need to be correctly configured to use the OLI materials.
- The interactive text contains questions that you answer and check for correctness.
- The text, however, is not fully supported on computer tablets or smartphones.



### Course Packet (book)

- We will be using the Math 13 Packet-Fall 2017 as the textbook during lecture.
- The course packet is about 400 pages in length and contains daily class exercises and project assignments.
- It can be purchased only at the BCC bookstore on the 5th floor. It retails for about $27.00.



### Scientific Calculator

- You are required to use a scientific calculator.
- Graphing and non-graphing calculators are OK.
- No smartphone calculators are allowed during midterms and final exam.



### Class Style

- A lot of time will be spent working collaboratively with other students.
- You will work in groups of 4-5 students that are randomly configured on a daily basis.
- Students will be expected to explore new topics together without an initial lecture.
- Lecture time is minimized.



### <a name="hw-policy"></a>Homework Assignments

There are three types of homework assignments:

- __Interactive OLI exercises__ that are embedded in the OLI text. You are encouraged to do these with other students.
- __Packet Project assignments__: There are about 7 project assignments during the 1st half of the course, and they are included in the packet. You will be writing small one-page, data analysis project papers. Projects will be due by a specific date. Each one will be checked off as completed or not; there is no credit for late work.
- __Packet Take-Home exercises__: These are daily exercises assigned during the 2nd half of the course, and they are included in the packet. They will be checked off as completed or not; there is no credit for late work.



### Grading Structure

Your course grade is based on homework, in-class participation, midterm exams, and a comprehensive final exam. The percentage breakdown for each component is as follows:

- 10% Class Activities
- 10% Interactive online OLI exercises
- 10% Project Assignments and Take Home Assignments
- 10% Online (OLI) Checkpoint quizzes
- 30% Two Midterm Exams	 (each midterm is 15%)
- 30% Final Exam (Tuesday Dec-12th from 8:00am to 9:50am)


Your final grade will be determined according to the following scale:

- A: 90%-100%
- B: 80%-89%
- C: 70%-79%
- D: 60%-69%
- F: below 60%



### Exams

- Midterm exams will include material and examples presented in lecture, examples from the textbook, and the exercises you are assigned in homework and for practice. 
- The Final Exam will be a comprehensive exam, covering all topics presented in the course. It is worth 30% of your course grade. The Final Exam will take place on the Tuesday of Final Exam week during class time.
- Absolutely no make-up exams will be given.
- You are allowed to use a scientific calculator during each exam. Other electronic devices such as smart phones, mobile devices, laptops, and tablets are NOT permitted during exams.
- Please keep all of your exams. This work is the only evidence outside of attending class of your efforts to succeed in the course.


### Extra Credit

- Students can receive 2 extra credit points by completing 20 hours of free math tutoring at the Learning Resource Center in Room 112 on the 1st floor.
- Complete the attached Tutoring Record sheet by having the tutor sign the sheet after each tutoring appointment.
- Appointments are available Mon-Thu, 9:00 a.m.-8 p.m; Fri, 9:00 a.m.-4 p.m; Sat, 10:00 a.m.– 4:00 p.m.


### Tutoring at BCC

Free math tutoring is available at the Learning Resource Center (LRC) in Room 112 (Mon-Th, 9:00am-8:00pm; Fri 9:00am-4:00pm; Sat 10:00am-4:00pm). Please make appointments in advance at the front floor.



### <a name="attendance-policy"></a> Attendance Policy

- Number of absences may not exceed 4 classes.
- Every additional absence beyond 4 absences requires that you submit documentation. 
- With one undocumented absence beyond 4 absences, I reserve the right to drop you from the course.
- While attending class, please help to maintain a decent learning environment.
- Return to class on-time after each break. Disruptive persons will be asked to leave the classroom. 
- Please be considerate of others; turn off your cell phones and put them away. 
- Students routinely checking/using phones will be asked to leave the classroom.
- I will take roll at a random time. If you are not present while I’m taking roll, you will be marked absent.
- If you leave early after I took roll, you will be marked absent.


### Dropping the course

There are no incomplete grades. The instructor may elect to drop you from the class if you miss more than six days of class. However, it is your responsibility to officially drop the course should you decide to do so, otherwise you may receive an F. The drop deadline for this semester is November 15th.


### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- I am not constantly checking my email: I may not reply on time.
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Cheating Policy

Do your own work. Collaborating on homework is fine—but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating is a very serious offense that I will not tolerate. If you are caught cheating on a homework assignment or during a test I will give you an F.


### Disabilities

Students with learning and/or physical disabilities can register in the PSSD office on the 2nd floor.  You may be entitled to extra time for test-taking and other services.  You can register any time during the semester, but entitlements are not retroactive.



### Justification for the Course

Satisfies the General Education and Analytical Thinking requirement for Associate Degrees. Provides foundation for more advanced study in mathematics and related fields. Satisfies the Quantitative Reasoning component required for transfer to UC, CSUC, and some independent four-year institutions. Acceptable for credit: CSU, UC. AA/AS area 4b, CSU area B4, IGETC area 2A.
